The beauty industry has come a long way. There has been a lot more awareness of the harmful effects of certain ingredients as more information and research are brought to light. Once they were considered acceptable in the beauty industry, ingredients such as parabens, phthalates, and sulfates are now avoided by beauty brands and consumers. However, ingredients such as squalene, mica, and silicones, which are often used in skincare and makeup, are rarely talked about. Although these ingredients may not be harmful to their consumers, they may be linked to animal cruelty, child labor, and negative environmental impact. 

By scraping skincare products at Sephora.com and extracting products that have squalene, mica, or silicones, I hope to bring awareness to other consumers about these ingredients and urge beauty brands to take responsibilities in ensuring their supply chains are fair, responsible and sustainable.
